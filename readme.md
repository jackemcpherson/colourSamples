# colourSamples

This Python script generates a JPEG image of a specified size and color.

You will be prompted to enter the width and height of the image, and the color code in HTML format (e.g., #FFFFFF for white).

The script will create an image of the specified size and color, and save it as a JPEG file in the output_files directory. The filename will be the color code without the leading '#'.
